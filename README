Installation Instructions (preliminary) for OpenSHMEM
-----------------------------------------------------

The library installs on top of GASNet and, when required, MPI.  MPI is
used purely for process launch.  GASNet provides a portable
communications layer for OpenSHMEM to work on top of.

The development versions of MPI are Open-MPI 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 but I
suspect any version that adheres to the "mpi" prefix for the
command-line tools will slot right in, and if not, the fix is pretty
trivial.

The main GASNet version has been 1.16.x during development, although
1.42.2 was used as well as a comparison and we have recently moved
to 1.18.0.

Currently the Makefile is set up to use the GNU C Compiler (4.x
series), but there's a relatively small number of changes that need to
be made to change that (e.g. debugging and optimization flags, PIC
option, C99 compliance).

There's a configure script.  This will eventually be the GNU autotools
setup, but for now it's just a basic shell script to give the same
kind of look-and-feel.  Accepts a --help option.  Doesn't (yet)
support the GNU separate-build-directory thing.

By default I'm using "smp" for development on a single machine, but
for e.g. an Infiniband cluster, just change this to "ibv" by choosing
a different conduit in the configure command.

Configure Usage
---------------

Here is how configure might be called on a cluster using Infiniband:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
                --with-gasnet-conduit=ibv     \
                --with-gasnet-root=/usr

On a cluster using gigabit as interconnect, or on a single SMP
machine:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
                --with-gasnet-conduit=mpi     \
                --with-gasnet-root=/opt/gasnet/everything

Optimized for SMP:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
                --with-gasnet-conduit=smp     \
                --with-gasnet-root=/usr

    (GASNet built with fast/large model)

Testing Environment
-------------------

1. SMP: 2 x 8 processor Nehalem, 32GB RAM, GASNet "mpi" & "smp"
   conduits, OpenMPI 1.4.3

2. Opteron cluster: ~ 30 nodes, 2-4 ppn, SDR IB interconnect, "ibv"
   conduit, OpenMPI 1.4.2 with slurm integration

3. Opteron cluster: ~ 250 nodes, 2-8 ppn, Gigabit interconnect, "mpi"
   conduit, OpenMPI 1.4.3 with pbs (called "tm") integration

Installation Notes
------------------

1. GASNet

On some cluster setups we have seen issues with larger segment sizes.
Restricting the segment allocation to 512MB has solved these problems.
Note that you can do this via an environment variable supported by
this library: see the man page for oshconfig(5).

2. ELF Library

There are 2 common ELF libraries: elfutils and libelf.  While all
local development (University of Houston) has used elfutils, we
encountered some portability issues between elfutils and libelf on
some remote systems.  Hopefully these have been addressed.
