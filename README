Installation Instructions (preliminary) for OpenSHMEM
-----------------------------------------------------

The library installs on top of GASNet and anything required by
whichever conduit you want to use with GASNet, e.g. an MPI.  GASNet
provides a portable communications layer for this implementation of
OpenSHMEM to work on top of.

The development versions of MPI are Open-MPI 1.4.{3,4,5} but I suspect
any version that adheres to the "mpi" prefix for the command-line
tools will slot right in, and if not, the fix is pretty trivial.
We've used MPICH and MVAPICH successfully too.

The main GASNet version has been 1.18.0 during development, although
1.42.2 and the 1.16.x series were used as well as a comparison for
backward compatibility.

Currently the Makefile is set up to use the GNU C Compiler (4.x
series), but there's a relatively small number of changes that need to
be made to change that (e.g. debugging and optimization flags, PIC
option, C99 compliance).

There's a configure script.  This will eventually be the GNU autotools
setup, but for now it's just a basic shell script to give the same
kind of look-and-feel.  The script accepts a --help option.  It
doesn't (yet) support the GNU separate-build-directory thing.

By default I'm using the "smp" conduit for development on a single
machine, but for e.g. an Infiniband cluster, just change this to "ibv"
by choosing a different conduit in the configure command.

Configure Usage
---------------

Here is how configure might be called on a cluster using Infiniband,
with debugging support (e.g. argument and PE range checking) and
operation tracing:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
                --with-gasnet-conduit=ibv     \
                --with-gasnet-root=/usr	      \
		--enable-debug --enable-trace

On a cluster using gigabit as interconnect, or on a single SMP
machine:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
                --with-gasnet-conduit=mpi     \
                --with-gasnet-root=/opt/gasnet/everything

Optimized for SMP:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
                --with-gasnet-conduit=smp     \
                --with-gasnet-root=/usr

    (GASNet built with fast/large model)

Testing Environment
-------------------

1. SMP: 2 x 8 processor Nehalem, 32GB RAM, GASNet "mpi" & "smp"
   conduits, OpenMPI 1.4.3

2. Opteron cluster: ~ 30 nodes, 2-4 ppn, SDR IB interconnect, "ibv"
   conduit, OpenMPI 1.4.2 with slurm integration

3. Opteron cluster: ~ 250 nodes, 2-8 ppn, Gigabit interconnect, "mpi"
   conduit, OpenMPI 1.4.3 with pbs (called "tm") integration

Installation Notes
------------------

1. GASNet & Infiniband

On some cluster setups we have seen issues with larger segment sizes.
Restricting the segment allocation to 512MB has solved these problems.
Note that you can do this via an environment variable supported by
this OpenSHMEM library: see the man page for oshconfig(5).  The kernel
parameters shmmax and shmall may affect this behavior.  Some notes on
setting these can be found here:

  http://www.puschitz.com/TuningLinuxForOracle.shtml#SettingSharedMemory

Other GASNet environment variables that may help include

  GASNET_PHYSMEM_NOPROBE

in conjunction with this library's SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_HEAP_SIZE
environment variable, and

  GASNET_NUM_QPS

to set the number of Infiniband queue-pairs.

2. ELF Library

There are 2 common ELF libraries:

  elfutils :: https://fedorahosted.org/elfutils/
  libelf   :: http://www.mr511.de/software/english.html

While all local development (University of Houston) has used elfutils
on a number of Linux distributions, we encountered some portability
issues between elfutils and libelf on some remote systems.  Hopefully
these have been addressed.

Pkg-Config
----------

pkg-config(1)

    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config

helps packages provide configuration information for other packages to
interact with them, so you can ask openshmem for its CFLAGS or
libraries for linking.  Add

    <install>/lib/pkgconfig

to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

This means you can compile/link programs as e.g. with Open64

    opencc $(pkg-config --cflags openshmem) \
        program.c \
            $(pkg-config --libs openshmem)

or any other compiler of your choice.

Module
------

The module(1) command

    http://modules.sourceforge.net/

allows users or sysadmins to simplify setting up extra packages.  A
file

    openshmem.module

is included as a template (although not installed anywhere by this
library).
