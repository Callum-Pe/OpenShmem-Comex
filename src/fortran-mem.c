/*
 * symmetric memory operations
 */

/*
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   POINTER (addr, A(1))
 *   INTEGER (length, errcode, abort)
 *   CALL SHPALLOC(addr, length, errcode, abort)
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   SHPALLOC  allocates a block of memory from the program's symmetric heap
 *   that is greater than or equal  to  the  size  requested.   To  maintain
 *   symmetric  heap  consistency,  all PEs in an program must call SHPALLOC
 *   with the same value of length; if any  processing  elements  (PEs)  are
 *   missing, the program will hang.

/*
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   POINTER (addr, A(1))
 *   INTEGER errcode, abort
 *   CALL SHPDEALLC(addr, errcode, abort)
 * 
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   SHPDEALLC  returns  a block of memory (allocated using SHPALLOC) to the
 *   list of available space in the symmetric heap.  To  maintain  symmetric
 *   heap  consistency, all processing elements (PEs) in a program must call
 *   SHPDEALLC with the same value of addr; if  any  PEs  are  missing,  the
 *   program hangs.

/*
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   POINTER (addr, A(1))
 *   INTEGER length, status, abort
 *   CALL SHPCLMOVE (addr, length, status, abort)
 * 
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   The SHPCLMOVE function either extends a symmetric  heap  block  if  the
 *   block  is  followed by a large enough free block or copies the contents
 *   of the existing block to a larger  block  and  returns  a  status  code
 *   indicating that the block was moved.  This function also can reduce the
 *   size of a block if the new length is less than  the  old  length.   All
 *   processing  elements  (PEs)  in  a program must call SHPCLMOVE with the
 *   same value of addr to maintain symmetric heap consistency; if  any  PEs
 *   are missing, the program hangs.
