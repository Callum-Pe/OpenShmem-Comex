Installation Instructions (preliminary) for OpenSHMEM
-----------------------------------------------------

The library installs on top of MPI & GASNet.  MPI is used purely for
process launch.  GASNet provides a portable communications layer for
OpenSHMEM to work on top of.

The development version of MPI is OpenMPI 1.4.2 but I suspect any
version that adheres to the "mpi" prefix for the command-line tools
will slot right in.

I have used GASNet 1.14.2 and 1.16.0 during development with identical
results.

Currently the Makefile is set up to use the GNU C Compiler, but
there's a relatively small number of changes that need to be made to
change that (e.g. debugging and optimization flags, dependency
generation, PIC option).

There's a file called make.include in this top-level directory where
you can change the GASNet conduit.  By default I'm using "mpi" for
development on an SMP platform, but for a Infiniband cluster, just
change this to "ibv".
