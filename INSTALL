Installation Instructions (preliminary) for OpenSHMEM
=====================================================

The library installs on top of GASNet and anything required by
whichever conduit you want to use with GASNet, e.g. an MPI.  GASNet
provides a portable communications layer for this implementation of
OpenSHMEM to work on top of.

The development versions of MPI are Open-MPI 1.4.{3,4,5} but I suspect
any version that adheres to the "mpi" prefix for the command-line
tools will slot right in, and if not, you don't have to use the
wrapper programs provided by the library, rather using the MPI
compilers and e.g. the pkg-config utility to locate headers and
libraries (described below).  We've used MPICH2 and MVAPICH2
successfully too.

The main GASNet version has been 1.18.x during development, although
the 1.42.x and 1.16.x series were used as well as a comparison for
backward compatibility.

Currently the Makefile is set up to use the GNU C Compiler (4.x
series), but there's a relatively small number of changes that need to
be made to change that (e.g. debugging and optimization flags, PIC
option, C99 compliance).

The "configure" script
======================

This script will eventually be the GNU autotools setup, but for now
it's just a basic shell script to give the same kind of look-and-feel.
The script accepts a --help option.  It doesn't (yet) support the GNU
separate-build-directory thing.

By default I'm using the "smp" conduit for development on a single
machine, but for e.g. an Infiniband cluster, just change this to "ibv"
by choosing a different conduit in the configure command.

Building GASNet
===============

GASNet can be configured in many weird and wonderful ways.  Unless
you're working in a very particular environment, it is probably
easiest to allow GASNet to auto-detect network support and configure
discovered conduits.

This library's configure script will list the conduits for you and
prompt for a choice if you do not choose one explicitly; if there is
exactly 1 conduit available, it will be used automatically.  A sample
configuration that the OpenSHMEM library's author has used is:

    1: 	  /path/to/gasnet-source-directory/configure \
    2: 	      --enable-segment-fast                  \
    3: 	      --disable-aligned-segments             \
    4: 	      --enable-throttle-poll                 \
    5:        --disable-udp                          \
    6: 	      --prefix=/path/to/install

This is for a general-purpose GNU/Linux system (or cluster):

    1:    path to configure script (build in separate directory)
    2: 	  "fast" (small messages) segment
    3: 	  address-space-randomization
    4: 	  throttled polling for SMP conduit
    5:    don't bother building UDP support, don't want it
    6: 	  where to install GASNet

Note that GASNet is only needed to build this OpenSHMEM library,
strictly speaking it does not need to be installed globally to
actually use the library.

Configure Usage
===============

Here is how configure might be called on a cluster using Infiniband,
with debugging support (e.g. argument and PE range checking) and
operation tracing:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
                --with-gasnet-conduit=ibv     \
                --with-gasnet-root=/usr	      \
		--enable-debug --enable-trace

On a cluster using gigabit as interconnect, or on a single SMP
machine:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
                --with-gasnet-conduit=mpi     \
                --with-gasnet-root=/opt/gasnet/large

Optimized for SMP (no MPI involved):

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/SHMEM          \
                --with-gasnet-conduit=smp     \
                --with-gasnet-root=/usr       \
                --enable-debug

    (GASNet built with fast/large model)

The default layout of an installation is as follows:

    .
    |-- bin
    |   |-- oshCC
    |   |-- oshcc
    |   |-- oshfort

Installation Notes
==================

GASNet & Infiniband
-------------------

On some cluster setups we have seen issues with larger segment sizes.
Restricting the segment allocation to 512MB has solved these problems.
Note that you can do this via an environment variable supported by
this OpenSHMEM library: see the man page for oshconfig(5).  The kernel
parameters shmmax and shmall may affect this behavior.  Some notes on
setting these can be found here:

  http://www.puschitz.com/TuningLinuxForOracle.shtml#SettingSharedMemory

Other GASNet environment variables that may help include

  GASNET_PHYSMEM_NOPROBE

in conjunction with this library's SHMEM_SYMMETRIC_HEAP_SIZE
environment variable, and

  GASNET_NUM_QPS

to set the number of Infiniband queue-pairs.

ELF Library
-----------

There are 2 common ELF libraries:

  elfutils :: https://fedorahosted.org/elfutils/
  libelf   :: http://www.mr511.de/software/english.html

While all local development (University of Houston) has used elfutils
on a number of Linux distributions, we encountered some portability
issues between elfutils and libelf on some remote systems.  Hopefully
these issues have been addressed.

N.B. we don't currently support other executable formats (XCOFF etc.).

Pkg-Config
==========

pkg-config(1)

    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config

helps packages provide configuration information for other packages to
interact with them, so you can ask OpenSHMEM for its CFLAGS or
libraries for linking.  Add

    <install>/lib/pkgconfig

to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.

This means you can compile/link programs as e.g. with Open64

    opencc $(pkg-config --cflags openshmem)     \
        program.c                               \
            $(pkg-config --libs openshmem)

or any other compiler of your choice (N.B. implementations on top of
MPI will require compilation in this manner with the appropriate MPI
compiler, such as mpicc).

Module
======

The module(1) command

    http://modules.sourceforge.net/

allows users or sysadmins to simplify setting up extra packages.

A sample file

    openshmem.module

will be created after configure is run and will be installed to

    <install>/modulefiles/openshmem

 LocalWords:  openshmem
